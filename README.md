## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to showcase the work done in this module. 
I will be periodically updating this repository.

# Pizza Project
This project shows how to create a pizza menu with various sizes and toppings and how much it would be once the order is complete.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The random moves of the computer versus the input of the user. The code of this game varies the movements of the computer based off the input
of the user and stays random. You will hear music and see flashing lights for the winner.

#Calculator
This is a basic four function calulator. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide. This is is presented in an attractive, web version.
